Just a place to try things...

# What do I have completed so far?

I have not been using nueral networks, my suspicion is I'm not really training at all (but I hope I am!)

I am leveraging pandas and scikit-learn tools to do what I think is just "basic statistics machine learning" (if that) and not doing true "deep learning" at this point

The added layer of TensorFlow or PyTorch will make this truly a "deep learning playground". For now, I am just doing basic machine learning.

- [x] Write a singular model that trains on a training set (producing a single-row, single-prediction, considering each line as independent events)
- [x] Write a multi-model that trains to predict "VOLUME" via 'x' amount of loops on a varying training set, and predicts "Low", "High", and "Close" based on ALL data row-by-row (producing a single-row, single-prediction, considering each line as independent events)
- [ ] Use the multiple models in the above, but produce a multi-day prediction (2-, 3-, 5-, 14-, 30-day stock price predictions)
- [ ] Write a multi-model that trains on a training set AND re-weights itself (true "Deep Learning", in my opinion: this would produce a single-row, single-prediction, considering each line as independent events)

- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:
